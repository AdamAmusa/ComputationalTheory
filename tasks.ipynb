    "### Bit Rotation\n",
    "**This task was completed using Python's [Bitwise operators.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/) The '0xff' operand masks out every bit but the last 8 bits of the binary value. The x<<n (Left Shift) operand the bits of x to the left by n positions, bits pushed to the left are discarded and replaced by zeros on to the right, Right Shift (x >> (32-n)); this shifts bits to the right by 32-n positions, bits to the right are discarded and zeros added to the left, this process brings the bits that were shifted to the left in the previous step to the right. OR | combines the results of the left and right side shift; this ensures that the bits are rotated by wrapping the left-shifted bits around to the right side.**\n",

    "Bit rotation is the process of each digit of a binary representation moving left or right, which is referred to as bit shifting. Except that the bits that fall off at one end are transferred to the other end, which means bits at the end of a left rotation transfer to the right end, whilst bits at the end of a right rotation transfer to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit rotation is often used encrypt confidential information, due to its sensitivity to small changes to the input and its ability to maintain data integrity (diffusion). Claude Shannon was the pioneer in the idea of using bit operations for cryptography, he introduced the concepts of confusion and diffusion. Confusion refers to the disconnection in the relation between the key and the encryption.\n",

    "The `ch(x, y, z)` uses bitwise operations to achieve functionality similar to a [2:1 Multiplexer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/multiplexer#:~:text=A%20multiplexer%2C%20sometimes%20simply%20referred%20to%20as%20%E2%80%9Cmux%E2%80%9D%2C,input%20control%2C%20and%20one%20output.); A 2:1 Multiplexer is a function or a machine that uses two inputs (y and z) and a selector (x) to produce a single output. The function `ch(x,y,z)` operates the same as having a collection of individual multiplexers, each assigned to one bit of the input values to output a single value. Each of the bits in x acts as a selector for a single multiplexer and selects a bit from y if the selector bit is 1 or z if it is 0. The conditional behavior of the function abides by the principles of diffusion and confusion in cryptographic design because its outputs are unpredictable and non-linear.\n",

    "[Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is one of the oldest algorithms used to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. It works by creating a list of integers from 2 to 100 (n). At first, p is assigned to 2, which is the smallest prime number. Loop through the list and enumerate the multiples of 2 within it, for example (2p, 3p, 4p), and mark them in the list; in the function, this is done by filtering the multiples from the list of numbers. You then find the smallest number in the newly appended list, overwrite p with that number, and repeat the algorithm until there is no number in the list greater than p. Finally, when the algorithm finishes, the output should be all prime numbers below 100 (n)."

    "#### **Permutation**\n",
    "Is the unique arrangements or ordering of elements in a specific set. The `permutation()` method is a recursive algorithm specialised in creating a list of possible permutations of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the algorithm works**\n",
    "1. Loop through elements in the list if the list is empty.\n",
    "2. For each of the elements add it to the current permutation.\n",
    "3. Recursively call the function with the remaining elements.\n",
    "4. Append the output to the list when no elements are left.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bubble Sort algorithm**\n",
    "A bubble sort algorithm is an algorithm used to sort elements in a list, It works through iterating through each element in the list and swapping the adjacent element if it is less than, and repeats until all the elements are sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the algorithm works:**\n",
    "1. Begin at the first element in the list.\n",
    "2. Compare the next element to the current element.\n",
    "3. If the next element is greater swap the values.\n",
    "4. Proceed to the next pair, and repeat until the last index of the list.\n",
    "5. After a complete iteration of the list the largest unsorted element of the list should have been moved to the last index.\n",
    "6. Repeat the process until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This method creates lists of permutations from an array containing values from 1 to 5, then a list of permutations from the permutations(generated_permutations,current_permutation, elements_to_permute) gets passed into the bubble_sort() method which sorts the values in all the arrays in the list using a bubble sort algorithm. After each sorting process, the method prints the permutation and the amount comparisons it takes for the sorting process to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The permutation algorithm was inspired by pseudo code from https://www.baeldung.com/cs/array-generate-all-permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "The bubble sort algorithm was learned from [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-algorithm/)'s explanation of the algorithm."
